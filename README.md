## About

Welcome to The Present Moment!  Reflect, ponder, and share your postive affirmations to focus on the things that matter most to you.

With all the challenges occuring throughout the globe, now more than ever do we need a routine to prime our minds to focus on things that will serve us, not stunt our growth.

Use the present moment to create a daily routine around randomised postive affirmation and spend a couple of minutes getting into a focused state about how the affirmation applies to your own life.
